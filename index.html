The activation by pilocarpine of M receptors present on vascular endothelial cells would lead to hypotension (not hypertension) via the release of NO. All of the other effects listed are typical of muscarinic antagonists."

Reflex tachycardia could be blocked at the heart with a beta blocker such as metoprolol or by ganglion blockers (mecamylamine) which prevent all autonomic reflexes. Dobutamine stimulates beta-1 receptors causing tachycardia. Phenylephrine stimulates alpha-1 receptors which would raise TPR and BP and evoke a reflex bradycardia that doesn’t block tachycardia caused by albuterol.

                "explanation": "Agonist 1 increases HR, presumably through direct activation of cardiac β₁ receptors because the effect is blocked by propranolol but is not influenced by the alpha blocker (prazosin), the ganglion blocker (mecamylamine), or blockade of M receptors (atropine). Only two of the listed drugs directly activate cardiac receptors: epinephrine and norepinephrine. For NE, any direct cardiac stimulation is counteracted by reflex bradycardia resulting from the increase in mean BP via its activation of α₁ receptors in blood vessels (it has no effects on β₂ vascular receptors). Therefore, agonist 1 is identified as epinephrine which activates both β₁ and β₂ receptors directly at low doses. To identify agonists 2 and 3, recognize that although the alpha blocker prazosin simply neutralizes the effect of agonist 2 on HR, it reverses the effect of agonist 3. This could occur only if agonist 3 was capable of β₁ receptor activation in the heart. Direct cardiac stimulation could occur with norepinephrine (agonist 3) but not with phenylephrine (agonist 2), which is a selective alpha-1 agonist."

Nitroprusside is used IV in severe HTN or hypertensive crisis, not for management of mild-to-moderate HTN. Losartan, which blocks AT-1 receptors, is associated with teratogenic effects during fetal development, as are the ACEIs. Nonselective beta blockers are not ideal for patients who suffer from peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, or asthma. Milrinone, like most inotropes, is not useful long-term in CHF patients. The drug has been shown to increase mortality with chronic use, and thus is indicated for acute CHF. Digoxin is currently the only inotrope used chronically."

Given sublingually, nitroglycerin is more effectively absorbed into the systemic circulation and has improved effectiveness in angina by this mode of administration. Effective absorption is unlikely to decrease reflex tachycardia or propensity toward methemoglobinemia. There is no bypass of the coronary circulation—nitrates actually decrease coronary vasospasm, which makes them effective in variant angina."

Discontinuance of HAART, after suppression of viral RNA copies below the sensitivity of the best current methods of analysis, is followed by the reemergence of detectable viral RNA in the blood within a few months."

Its onset of anticoagulation activity is slow, and its impact on individual coagulation factors depends on their half-lives. Factor VII and protein C have much shorter half-lives than prothrombin, and so the extrinsic pathway and protein C system are the first to be affected by warfarin.

Bile acid sequestrants bind acidic drugs such as warfarin, preventing their gastrointestinal absorption (decreasing prothrombin time), and cimetidine inhibits the metabolism of warfarin, causing an increase in PT. Vitamin K restores levels of prothrombin and several other coagulation factors, but the action is slow (24 to 48 hours). Due to antiplatelet effects, even low doses of ASA may enhance bleeding in patients on warfarin."
