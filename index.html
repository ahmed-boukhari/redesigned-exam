Reflex tachycardia could be blocked at the heart with a beta blocker such as metoprolol or by ganglion blockers (mecamylamine) which prevent all autonomic reflexes. Dobutamine stimulates beta-1 receptors causing tachycardia. Phenylephrine stimulates alpha-1 receptors which would raise TPR and BP and evoke a reflex bradycardia that doesn’t block tachycardia caused by albuterol.

                "explanation": "Agonist 1 increases HR, presumably through direct activation of cardiac β₁ receptors because the effect is blocked by propranolol but is not influenced by the alpha blocker (prazosin), the ganglion blocker (mecamylamine), or blockade of M receptors (atropine). Only two of the listed drugs directly activate cardiac receptors: epinephrine and norepinephrine. For NE, any direct cardiac stimulation is counteracted by reflex bradycardia resulting from the increase in mean BP via its activation of α₁ receptors in blood vessels (it has no effects on β₂ vascular receptors). Therefore, agonist 1 is identified as epinephrine which activates both β₁ and β₂ receptors directly at low doses. To identify agonists 2 and 3, recognize that although the alpha blocker prazosin simply neutralizes the effect of agonist 2 on HR, it reverses the effect of agonist 3. This could occur only if agonist 3 was capable of β₁ receptor activation in the heart. Direct cardiac stimulation could occur with norepinephrine (agonist 3) but not with phenylephrine (agonist 2), which is a selective alpha-1 agonist."

Its onset of anticoagulation activity is slow, and its impact on individual coagulation factors depends on their half-lives. Factor VII and protein C have much shorter half-lives than prothrombin, and so the extrinsic pathway and protein C system are the first to be affected by warfarin.

Bile acid sequestrants bind acidic drugs such as warfarin, preventing their gastrointestinal absorption (decreasing prothrombin time), and cimetidine inhibits the metabolism of warfarin, causing an increase in PT. Vitamin K restores levels of prothrombin and several other coagulation factors, but the action is slow (24 to 48 hours).
