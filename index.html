                explanation: "Using first-order kinetics: After 1 half-life (4 hours), the concentration would be 50% of C⁰. So C⁰ = 50 × 2 = 100 mg/L. Using Vd = Dose/C⁰: Vd = 400 mg / 100 mg/L = 4 L. However, this gives us 4L at time zero. Since we measured 50 mg/L after 4 hours (1 half-life), we need to work backwards: Vd = 400 mg / 50 mg/L = 8 L."
