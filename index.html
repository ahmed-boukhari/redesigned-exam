Only two of the listed drugs directly activate cardiac receptors: epinephrine and norepinephrine. For NE, any direct cardiac stimulation is counteracted by reflex bradycardia resulting from the increase in mean BP via its activation of α₁ receptors in blood vessels (it has no effects on β₂ vascular receptors). Therefore, agonist 1 is identified as epinephrine which activates both β₁ and β₂ receptors directly at low doses. To identify agonists 2 and 3, recognize that although the alpha blocker prazosin simply neutralizes the effect of agonist 2 on HR, it reverses the effect of agonist 3. This could occur only if agonist 3 was capable of β₁ receptor activation in the heart.

Nicotinic receptors are excitatory via direct coupling to cation channels (Na/K), and their activation does not initiate second messenger pathways. Other CNS transmitter receptors that are directly coupled to ion channels include those for GABA and glutamic acid. Almost all CNS receptors for DA, NE, 5HT, and opioid peptides are coupled to ion channels via second messenger systems."

Acetaminophen is metabolized mainly via conjugation reactions, but a minor pathway involving P-450 (probably the CYP2E1 isoform) results in formation of small amounts of the reactive metabolite, which is (normally) rapidly inactivated by GSH. The chronic ingestion of more than average amounts of ethanol induces the formation of the P-450 isozyme that converts acetaminophen to its reactive metabolite. Thus, more-than-normal amounts of N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine would be formed in an overdose situation, resulting in enhanced hepatotoxicity."

Bile acid sequestrants bind acidic drugs such as warfarin, preventing their gastrointestinal absorption (decreasing prothrombin time), and cimetidine inhibits the metabolism of warfarin, causing an increase in PT. Vitamin K restores levels of prothrombin and several other coagulation factors, but the action is slow (24 to 48 hours). Due to antiplatelet effects, even low doses of ASA may enhance bleeding in patients on warfarin."
